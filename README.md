Hi there and welcome to the new Bamazon Car Store! 

Using the command line you can easily see what inventory we have in stock and how much of product! 

Step 1: Launch the program in the command line 

Step 2: The system will display the list of all available prodcuts 

Step 3: The program will ask for the ID of the item that you want to buy 

Step 4: After selecting an ID the program will ask how much you would like to buy (quantity)

Step 5: If there is not enough is stock to complete the purchase, the program will tell the user that to select a different product or lesser quantity. 

Step 6: If there is enough is stock then the total price will be shown to the user and product will be purchased

Step 7: After the item is purchased, the table of products is updated and shown again 

Step 8: The program then redisplays the available products and asks what they would like to purchase next
